## Description
This is #1 of the Series of Spectacularly Silly (yet fun!) websites to come. This project is a tribute to 3 absolutely inspiring artists:
1. Makoto Shinkai san for making my favorite film of all time - Kimi No Na Wa. 
2. Banksy for being totally [badass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXKE0nAMmg4).
3. Soham De for being an incredible artist I personally know who never fails to inspire me.

## Key Learnings
* Applying HTML5, CSS3, JS
* Building silly websites is actually fun :P

## Acknowledgments
I would like to credit my really cool CS Professor Debayan Gupta (again) for being the reason behind my interest in CS. 
I would also like to thank my best friend "smol gurl" for being my biggest inspiration.
